# HyTale Clients
This is a list of HyTale clietns tested with HighElf

## Release patch line
| Build Number | Date Version | ShipOfYarn file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2026.01.13-dcad8778f | release/windows/v1-windows-amd64.pwr |
| 2 | ? | release/windows/v2-windows-amd64.pwr |
| 3 | 2026.01.15-c04fdfe10 | release/windows/v3-windows-amd64.pwr |

| 7 | 2026.01.28-87d03be09 | release/windows/v7-windows-amd64.pwr |

Build number 2 does not boot for me. Needs more debugging. Could just be a bad patch idk.


## Pre-release patch line
| Build Number | Date Version | ShipOfYarn file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  | pre-release/windows/v1-windows-amd64.pwr |
| 2 |  | pre-release/windows/v2-windows-amd64.pwr |
| 3 |  | pre-release/windows/v3-windows-amd64.pwr |

Please note: While HighElf does support both patch lines, I personally will not be testing all vers of the game
My main focus will be getting the main release vers of the game working. Gives me more time to fix and edit things as needed on a stable build of the game.
