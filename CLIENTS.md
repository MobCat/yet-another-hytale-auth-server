# HyTale Clients
This is a list of HyTale clietns tested with HighElf
These build hash numbers may be OS specific (I used windows for testing) but the dates should be the same for all OS vers

## Release patch line

| 2 | 2026.01.13-50e69c385 | release/windows/v2-windows-amd64.pwr | Hotfixes: 13 January 2026 |
| 3 | 2026.01.15-c04fdfe10 | release/windows/v3-windows-amd64.pwr | Hotfixes: 15 January 2026 |

Build number 2 does not boot for me. Needs more debugging. Could just be a bad patch idk.


## Pre-release patch line

| 16 | 2026.01.28-87d03be09 | pre-release/windows/v16-windows-amd64.pwr | Same build hash as release v7 |

Please note: While HighElf does support both patch lines, I personally will not be testing all vers of the game
My main focus will be getting the main release vers of the game working. Gives me more time to fix and edit things as needed on a stable build of the game.

Note 2: For any pre-release patches that share the same build numbers as release, HighElf will default to using release data for this client. This may cause issues.

Note 3: It looks like I need to do more research on these build date ver things. As the pre-release vers that share build dates and hashes with release vers have notes on boot telling you that you are running a pre-release ver of the game (except for pre-release build 4)
So the game is different I think, but not sure what is different other then some flags to say this is a pre-release build.
